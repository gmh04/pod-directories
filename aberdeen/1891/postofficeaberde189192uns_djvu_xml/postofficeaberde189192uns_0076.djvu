	<LINE>PARCEL TOST— (Inland).</LINE>
	<LINE>Parcels not exceeding 11 lbs. in weight are received at any Post Office for</LINE>

	<LINE>transmission as a parcel, and should bear the words "Parcel Post,"— which</LINE>
	<LINE>should be clearly written in the left-hand top corner.</LINE>
	<LINE>The following are the principal conditions and regulations :—</LINE>
	<LINE>The size allowed for an Inland Postal Parcel is —</LINE>
	<LINE>Gi-eatest length - - - - - 3 ft. 6 in.</LINE>

	<LINE>A parcel measuring 3 ft. 6 in. in its longest dimension may measure as</LINE>
	<LINE>much as 2 ft. 6 in. in girth, i.e., round its thickest part; or—</LINE>
	<LINE>A shorter parcel may be thicker ; thus, if it measure no more than 3 ft.</LINE>
	<LINE>in length, it may measure as much as 3 ft. in girth, i.e., round its</LINE>
	<LINE>thickest part.</LINE>
	<LINE>The rates of Postage are, for a Parcel —</LINE>

	<LINE>Parcels must not be posted in a letter box, but must be taken into a Post</LINE>
	<LINE>Office and handed over the counter, and a parcel should not be left until the</LINE>
	<LINE>weight, size, and postage have been tested by the clerk at the counter. Care</LINE>
	<LINE>must be taken that every parcel bears a clear address.</LINE>
	<LINE>If a packet bearing the words " Parcel Post," or otherwise clearly marked</LINE>
	<LINE>as intended for transmission as a parcel, is not posted in accordance with this</LINE>
	<LINE>regulation, it is treated as a letter or book packet, if it is fully prepaid at the</LINE>
	<LINE>rate proper to either, and is otherwise in accordance with the letter or book</LINE>
	<LINE>post regulations. If such a packet is not fully prepaid at the letter or book</LINE>
	<LINE>post rate, it will be treated as a parcel, and will be charged on delivery with a</LINE>
	<LINE>fine of Id., together with the deficient postage, if any, at the parcel post rate.</LINE>
	<LINE>Parcels which bear on the outside any writing or drawing of an indecent or</LINE>
	<LINE>offensive nature, or within which any contents of a like nature may be</LINE>
	<LINE>observed, and parcels containing gunpowder, cartridges, lucifer matches or</LINE>
	<LINE>anything explosive or liable to sudden combustion, bladders containing liquid,</LINE>
	<LINE>live animals, grossly offensive or filthy matter, and anything in a condition</LINE>
	<LINE>likely to injure other parcels, or any officer of the Post Office, are prohibited.</LINE>
	<LINE>If any such parcel be tendered for posting, it is refused, or, if detected in</LINE>
	<LINE>transit, it is detained.</LINE>
	<LINE>Parcels containing fish, game, meat, eggs, &amp;c, or knives, or other sharp</LINE>
	<LINE>instruments, can only be sent if so packed as to prevent all risk of injury to</LINE>
	<LINE>other parcels. Liquids or semi-liquids are not accepted unless in bottles or</LINE>
	<LINE>cans securely stoppered ; nor powders, unless so packed that they cannot</LINE>
	<LINE>escape in transmission. Bottles or glass in any form can be accepted only</LINE>
	<LINE>when so packed as to be secure from breakage. If a parcel be tendered in a</LINE>
	<LINE>damaged or insecure condition it will be refused. If a parcel in such condi-</LINE>
	<LINE>tion is observed in transit it is, if possible, made secure and sent forward :</LINE>
	<LINE>but, if it cannot be so secured, it is detained.</LINE>
	<LINE>Parcels known to contain a letter, packet, or parcel intended for delivery at</LINE>
	<LINE>an address other than that borne on the parcel itself are prohibited.</LINE>
	<LINE>Parcels addressed to a Post Office to be called for, or to a person residing</LINE>
	<LINE>beyond the free postal delivery, are kept three weeks. At the end of one</LINE>
	<LINE>week, if the parcel bears on the outside the sender's name and address, a</LINE>
	<LINE>notice of the fact that the parcel has not been delivered is sent to him.</LINE>
	<LINE>Parcels addressed to a ship are kept one month.</LINE>
	<LINE>If, however, such a parcel contains perishable matter it is kept only 48</LINE>
	<LINE>hours ; and should it become offensive, it may be disposed of at any time as</LINE>
	<LINE>the Postmaster-General may direct.</LINE>
	<LINE>Parcels addressed to a Post Office "to be called for," and only such parcels,</LINE>
	<LINE>are liable to a demurrage charge at the rate of Id. a day after they have re-</LINE>
	<LINE>mained in the Office one clear day, counting as a day the period during</LINE>
	<LINE>which the Office is ordinarily open to the public.</LINE>
	<LINE>No demurrage is charged on parcels addressed to persons residing outside</LINE>
	<LINE>the limits of the free delivery, or to persons on board ship.</LINE>
