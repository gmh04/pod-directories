	<LINE>Inland Newspapers are subject to the following regulations : —</LINE>
	<LINE>To have the privilege of passing as a newspaper, the publication must first</LINE>
	<LINE>have been accepted as a newspaper by the Postmaster-General, and</LINE>
	<LINE>have been placed on a register at the General Pest-Office, from which</LINE>
	<LINE>it is liable to be removed, either through the non-renewal of the regis-</LINE>
	<LINE>tration fee, 5s., year by year, or in consequence of any change which</LINE>
	<LINE>may deprive it of the characteristics of a newspaper. Registration for</LINE>
	<LINE>inland circulation includes registration for transmission abroad.</LINE>
	<LINE>For each inland newspaper, whether posted singly or in a packet, the</LINE>
	<LINE>postage, when prepaid, is one halfpenny ; bat a packet containing two</LINE>
	<LINE>or more registered newspapers is not chargeable with a higher rate of</LINE>
	<LINE>postage than would be chargeable on a book packet of the same weight,</LINE>
	<LINE>viz., one halfpenny for every 2 oz., or fraction of 2 oz.</LINE>
	<LINE>A newspaper posted unpaid, or a packet of newspapers posted either unpaid</LINE>
	<LINE>or insufficiently paid, is treated as an unpaid or insufficiently paid</LINE>
	<LINE>book packet of the same weight.</LINE>
	<LINE>The postage must be prepaid either by an adhesive stamp or by the use of a</LINE>
	<LINE>stamped wrapper.</LINE>
	<LINE>No newspaper can be sent through the post a second time for the original</LINE>
	<LINE>postage ; for each transmission a fresh postage is required.</LINE>
	<LINE>Every newspaper must be posted either without a cover, or in a cover en-</LINE>
	<LINE>tirely open at both ends, so as to admit of easy removal for examination.</LINE>
	<LINE>If this rule be infringed, the newspaper is treated as a letter.</LINE>
	<LINE>Every newspaper must be so folded as to admit of the title being readily</LINE>
	<LINE>seen.</LINE>
	<LINE>A newspaper, or a packet of newspapers, which contains any inclosure</LINE>
	<LINE>(except supplements) is charged as a letter ; unless the inclosure be</LINE>
	<LINE>such as might be sent at the book rate of postage, and the entire packet</LINE>
	<LINE>be sufficiently prepaid as a book packet, in which case it is allowed to</LINE>
	<LINE>pass.</LINE>
	<LINE>A newspaper which has any letter, or any communication of the nature of</LINE>
	<LINE>a letter, written in it or upon its cover, will be charged as an unpaid or</LINE>
	<LINE>insufficiently paid letter.</LINE>

	<LINE>A packet posted wholly unpaid is charged with double the book</LINE>
	<LINE>and if posted partially prepaid, with double the deficiency.</LINE>
	<LINE>Every book packet must either have no cover, or a cover entirely open at</LINE>
	<LINE>both ends, so as to admit of the contents being easily withdrawn for exami-</LINE>
	<LINE>nation. It may contain any number of separate books or other publications,</LINE>
	<LINE>prints, or maps, and any quantity of paper, parchment, or vellum, either</LINE>
	<LINE>printed, written, plain, or any mixture of the three ; together with whatever</LINE>
	<LINE>is necessary for the safe transmission of literary matter, or usually appertains</LINE>
	<LINE>thereto, to the exclusion of letters or any enclosure sealed or otherwise</LINE>
	<LINE>closed against inspection, or any communication of the nature of a letter</LINE>
	<LINE>written in any such packet, or on its cover. Entries, however, merely</LINE>
	<LINE>stating who sends the book, &amp;c, or to whom it is given, are not regarded as</LINE>
