	<LINE>THE</LINE>
	<LINE>Scottish Provident Institution,</LINE>
	<LINE>Head Office — 6 St. Andrew Square, Edinburgh.</LINE>
	<LINE>In this Society are combined the advantages of</LINE>
	<LINE>MUTUAL ASSURANCE with MODERATE PREMIUMS.</LINE>
	<LINE>THE PREMIUMS are so Moderate that an Assurance of</LINE>
	<LINE>.=£1200 to .=81250 (with profits) may generally be secured</LINE>
	<LINE>from the first for the yearly payment which would usually</LINE>
	<LINE>elsewhere assure (with profits) £1000 only — being equivalent</LINE>
	<LINE>to an immediate Bonus of 20 to 25 per cent.</LINE>
	<LINE>The WHOLE PROFITS go to the Policy-holders, on a</LINE>
	<LINE>system at once safe and equitable — no share being given to</LINE>
	<LINE>those by whose early death there is a loss. On this principle</LINE>
	<LINE>large additions have been, and will be, made to the Policies</LINE>
	<LINE>of those who live to participate, notwithstanding the lowness</LINE>
	<LINE>of the Premiums.</LINE>
	<LINE>The SURPLUS at last Investigation was £1,051,035, which,</LINE>
	<LINE>after reserving one-third, was divided among 9384 Policies</LINE>
	<LINE>entitled to participate. First additions were (with few excep-</LINE>
	<LINE>tions) from 18 or 20 to 34 per cent., according to age and class.</LINE>
	<LINE>Other Policies were increased in all 50 to 80 per cent, and</LINE>
	<LINE>upwards.</LINE>
	<LINE>N.B. — It is to be borne in mind that had the higher premiums</LINE>
	<LINE>usually charged been paid, not only would the original Assurance</LINE>
	<LINE>have been greater, but the amount of Bonus Additions would have</LINE>
	<LINE>been correspondingly larger.</LINE>
	<LINE>RESULTS REPORTED FOR 1890.</LINE>
	<LINE>The NEW ASSURANCES completed were £1,032,008,</LINE>
	<LINE>Being for the 17 th year in succession above a Million.</LINE>
	<LINE>PREMIUMS in year, £600,820. Total INCOME, £907,648.</LINE>
	<LINE>The Expenses were under 10 per cent, of Premium Income.</LINE>
	<LINE>CLAIMS of year (including Bonus*) were £431,466.</LINE>
	<LINE>* Averaging 49 per cent, on Policies participating.</LINE>
	<LINE>THE FUNDS AMOUNTED TO £7,356,619,</LINE>
	<LINE>Their Increase in the year being £363,150.</LINE>
	<LINE>Arrangements as to Surrender, Non-forfeiture, Early Payment</LINE>
	<LINE>of Claims, &amp;c, are specially liberal. Policies, as a rule, are</LINE>
	<LINE>World-Wide after five years — provided the Assured has attained</LINE>
